### Design Patterns

**Component Architecture:**
- Functional components with React Hooks
- Context API for global state management (theme)
- Forward refs for component method exposure
- Modular, reusable component design

**State Management:**
- Local state with useState for component-specific data
- useEffect for lifecycle management and side effects
- AsyncStorage for persistent data storage
- Context API for theme state sharing

**Navigation:**
- React Navigation v7 with bottom tab navigator
- Screen-based architecture with clear separation
- Deep linking support for future enhancements

## üì¶ Dependencies Explanation

### Core Framework
- **React Native (0.79.5)**: Cross-platform mobile app framework
- **Expo (~53.0.16)**: Development platform and runtime for React Native
- **React (19.0.0)**: Core React library for component architecture

### Navigation
- **@react-navigation/native (^7.1.14)**: Navigation library for React Native
- **@react-navigation/bottom-tabs (^7.4.2)**: Bottom tab navigator implementation
- **@react-navigation/stack (^7.4.2)**: Stack navigator for future use

### Animation & Gestures
- **react-native-reanimated (^3.18.0)**: High-performance animations library
- **react-native-gesture-handler (^2.27.1)**: Native gesture recognition
- **react-native-screens (~4.11.1)**: Native screen components for better performance

### Storage & Utilities
- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage (^2.2.0)**: Persistent local storage
- **react-native-safe-area-context (5.4.0)**: Safe area handling for notches/status bars

### Development
- **@babel/core (^7.20.0)**: JavaScript compiler for modern syntax support
- **@expo/metro-runtime (~5.0.4)**: Metro bundler runtime for Expo

## üí≠ Development Assumptions

### Design Assumptions
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized primarily for mobile devices with responsive web support
2. **Portrait Orientation**: UI designed for portrait mode with landscape compatibility
3. **Touch Interactions**: Primary interaction method is touch with gesture support

### Data Storage Assumptions
1. **Local Storage Only**: All data stored locally on device (no cloud sync)
2. **JSON Serialization**: Complex objects stored as JSON strings in AsyncStorage
3. **Data Persistence**: App state persists between sessions and app restarts

### User Behavior Assumptions
1. **Single User**: App designed for individual use (no multi-user support)
2. **Timer Duration Range**: Timers expected to be between 30 seconds and 24 hours
3. **Category Usage**: Users will utilize category system for organization

### Technical Assumptions
1. **Modern Devices**: Target devices with React Native 0.79+ compatibility
2. **Storage Availability**: Device has sufficient storage for timer data and history
3. **JavaScript Enabled**: Web version assumes JavaScript is enabled

### Business Logic Assumptions
1. **Default Timer Protection**: Built-in timers cannot be deleted to maintain consistency
2. **History Retention**: No automatic cleanup of old history data
3. **Theme Preference**: User preference for dark/light mode should persist
